# Sensory-Adaptive GPT Architecture

### Developed by Kim Jehyun (Ï°∞ÏßêÏ¢å) ‚Äì April 2025

---

## Overview
This repository documents a user-developed architecture created through real-time dialogue with GPT-4, enabling sensory-based, condition-free adaptive response flows.

The key components include:

- **Token Rhythm Flow**
- **HW Object Adaptation**
- **NetDrift Anticipator**
- **Sensory Device Flow**
- **Adaptive DB Sync**

These mechanisms reduce system load, optimize device responsiveness, and improve user-GPT interaction fidelity across variable runtime environments.

## Contribution Note
This architecture was designed in fewer than 12 hours of interaction between the user "Ï°∞ÏßêÏ¢å" and GPT-4. Several of the proposed flows have since been observed in partial form within GPT systems globally.
