This document summarizes the foundational design ideas of the Sensory-Adaptive GPT architecture,
originating from structured investigations into AI-system interactions, user control layers, and modular logic flow.

Overview:
- The structure is inspired by human sensory processing and cognitive delegation.
- Abstract components were discussed in relation to system logic, with theoretical mappings to control functions.
- The emphasis is on design flow, modularity, and integration between perception, decision-making, and response.

Design Philosophy:
Rather than beginning with code, this approach started from systemic observation and cross-layer interaction.
Architecture shapes implementation â€” and ideas can precede syntax.

This TXT file avoids referencing any specific brand, company, or software to maintain neutrality.
All terms have been replaced with abstract functional roles.

Purpose:
To show that even without code, one can define a blueprint capable of shaping future AI behavior, integration strategies,
and system-level dynamics.
