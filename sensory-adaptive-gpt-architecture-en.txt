Title: Sensory-Adaptive GPT Architecture (Draft v1.0)

This document outlines a visionary architecture designed by Jehyun Kim (aka 조짐좌), 
intended to explore AI integration, hardware-software interaction, and system-level control 
without writing a single line of code.

Key Concepts:
- A modular system mimicking human perception, decision-making, and action.
- Knox as the ‘eyes and ears’, AI Core as the ‘brain’, GOS as memory/policy management, 
  and SDHMS as the 'nervous system'.
- SmartThings as an extended control layer across IoT devices.

Background:
This idea began as a deep analysis into Samsung’s layered software ecosystem, 
eventually evolving into a structured philosophy: 
Architecture can dictate implementation, user policy, and even socio-technical boundaries.

Why No Code?
Because understanding the system as a whole can be more impactful than lines of syntax.
Sometimes, theory precedes execution — and Jehyun Kim proves it.

This is not just a README. This is a statement.
Jehyun Kim didn’t write code.
He rewrote the system’s logic.
